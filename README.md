<p>Hi there ðŸ‘‹</p>

<p>I'm an engineering student at the Federal Univesity of Alagoas, looking for new opportunities in the TI area.</p>

<p>In my graduation I had my first contact with the programming language, which awoke in me a great desire to develop myself in this area.</p>

<p>During the graduation period, I was able to apply my knowledge in programming language in three research projects in which I worked with large amounts of data for statistical analysis and numerical calculations.</p>

<p>I currently work in a solar energy design and installation company. In it I was able to apply my knowledge in programming to improve the development and monitoring processes of projects, using VBA together with Execel.</p>

<p>I've had some contact with C, C++, Java and Python.</p>

<p>I'm currently learning HTML and CSS at <a href="https://www.cursoemvideo.com/" target="_blank">Cursoemvideo.com</a> and I can already develop small projects on my own.</p>
